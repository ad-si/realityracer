# StreetMapRacer

A 2D racing game which is based on open street map data.
You either define a new race-track and set the first highscore or you try to improve on the highscore of somebody else on an already defined track.

E.g you can try to be the fastest on the track Brandenburger Tor - Alexanderplatz
